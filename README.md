# World-Demographics-Scraper-Analysis
This project scrapes the [Countries in the World by Population (2025)](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country) table and performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to uncover insights into global and continental population trends.

Check the Notebook in [Code/](Code/) for a detailed explanation of the scraping process ( as comments in the code cells), as well as plot interpretations.
